# MLOps-Tools


## Introduction
Welcome to MLOps-Tools, a repository dedicated to the operational aspects of machine learning. This repository serves as a centralized hub for projects that streamline and enhance the machine learning lifecycle, from data gathering and model training to deployment and monitoring. Our goal is to provide robust solutions that embody the principles of MLOps, ensuring that machine learning systems are as maintainable and scalable as traditional software.

## Project-1: Airflow Spotify ETL
This project is an educational exploration into Apache Airflow, focusing on its use in orchestrating an ETL pipeline. The ETL process extracts data from Spotify's API, transforms it, and loads it into a CSV file for analysis.
